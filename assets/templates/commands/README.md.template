# OpenSpec-Flow Slash Commands

Claude Code slash commands for OpenSpec-Flow integration.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/openspec-flow:list` | List all OpenSpec changes |
| `/openspec-flow:work <CHANGE_ID>` | Generate work brief |
| `/openspec-flow:implement <CHANGE_ID>` | Implement change |
| `/openspec-flow:review <CHANGE_ID>` | Review implementation |
| `/openspec-flow:log <CHANGE_ID>` | Generate flow log |
| `/openspec-flow:help` | Show help and usage |

## Usage

### From Claude Code Chat

Simply type the slash command:

```
/openspec-flow:list
/openspec-flow:work add-feature
/openspec-flow:implement add-feature
```

### Natural Language

You can also use natural language:

```
"List OpenSpec changes"
"Generate work brief for add-feature"
"Implement add-feature"
```

## What These Commands Do

All commands execute **within Claude Code** - no need to switch to terminal or run npm scripts manually.

They integrate with the Node.js CLI (`tooling/openspec-flow/`) but handle execution automatically.

## Architecture Integration

Every command automatically:
- Loads CLAUDE.md conventions
- References project-context.md for tech stack
- Applies {{project.name}} patterns
- Enforces project constraints
- Creates proper file structure

## Example Workflow

```
You: /openspec-flow:list
Me:  [Shows table of changes]

You: /openspec-flow:work add-feature
Me:  [Generates work brief, shows summary]

You: /openspec-flow:implement add-feature
Me:  [Implements following architecture patterns]

You: /openspec-flow:review add-feature
Me:  [Reviews compliance and quality]

You: /openspec-flow:log add-feature
Me:  [Creates flow log documentation]
```

## Notes

- Commands work entirely within Claude Code
- No terminal switching required
- All output shown in chat
- Files created/modified automatically
- Full integration with repository conventions
