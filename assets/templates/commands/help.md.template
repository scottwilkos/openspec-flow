# OpenSpec-Flow Help

Guide to using OpenSpec-Flow within Claude Code.

## Available Commands

### `/openspec-flow:list`
List all OpenSpec changes with their status and task completion.

**Usage:**
```
/openspec-flow:list
```

**Output:** Table of changes with ID, title, status, and task progress

---

### `/openspec-flow:work <CHANGE_ID>`
Generate a comprehensive work brief for a change.

**Usage:**
```
/openspec-flow:work add-feature
```

**Output:**
- Creates `openspec/changes/<CHANGE_ID>/work-brief.md`
- Displays summary with tech stack and constraints

---

### `/openspec-flow:implement <CHANGE_ID>`
Implement an OpenSpec change following architecture patterns.

**Usage:**
```
/openspec-flow:implement add-feature
```

**Process:**
1. Loads work brief
2. Reviews requirements
3. Implements code following {{project.name}} patterns
4. Creates entities, handlers, endpoints, tests
5. Applies architectural patterns

---

### `/openspec-flow:review <CHANGE_ID>`
Review implementation against spec and architecture.

**Usage:**
```
/openspec-flow:review add-feature
```

**Checks:**
- Requirements alignment
- Compliance with constraints
- Security
- Code quality
- Architecture patterns

---

### `/openspec-flow:log <CHANGE_ID>`
Generate implementation flow log.

**Usage:**
```
/openspec-flow:log add-feature
```

**Output:**
- Creates `openspec/changes/<CHANGE_ID>/flow-log.md`
- Comprehensive documentation of implementation

---

## Quick Workflow

```
1. /openspec-flow:list
   -> See available changes

2. /openspec-flow:work add-feature
   -> Generate work brief

3. /openspec-flow:implement add-feature
   -> Implement following patterns

4. /openspec-flow:review add-feature
   -> Verify compliance

5. /openspec-flow:log add-feature
   -> Document implementation
```

## Tech Stack (From Configuration)

- **Runtime**: {{tech.runtime}}
- **Orchestration**: {{tech.orchestration}}
- **Database**: {{tech.database}}
- **Messaging**: {{tech.messaging}}
- **Storage**: {{tech.storage}}

---

## Critical Constraints

{{#each constraints}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}

---

## Natural Language Alternatives

Instead of slash commands, you can also just say:

- "List OpenSpec changes"
- "Generate work brief for add-feature"
- "Implement add-feature following the work brief"
- "Review the implementation"
- "Create flow log"
