# OpenSpec-Flow Help

OpenSpec-Flow bridges OpenSpec (specification-driven change management) with Claude Flow (multi-agent orchestration) via Claude Code.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g openspec-flow
openspec-flow setup
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/list-specs` | List all OpenSpec changes |
| `/work <id>` | Generate work brief |
| `/implement <id>` | Implement the change |
| `/verify <id>` | Verify implementation |
| `/review <id>` | Review against requirements |
| `/deferred <id>` | Analyze incomplete tasks |
| `/log <id>` | Create flow log |

## Workflow

```
1. /list-specs          - See available changes
2. /work CHANGE-001     - Generate work brief
3. /implement CHANGE-001 - Implement tasks
4. /verify CHANGE-001   - Verify build and tests
5. /deferred CHANGE-001 - Check incomplete items
6. /log CHANGE-001      - Document implementation
```

## MCP Tools

The following tools are available:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_changes` | List all OpenSpec changes |
| `generate_work_brief` | Create work brief |
| `get_change_context` | Get full change context |
| `analyze_deferred` | Analyze incomplete tasks |
